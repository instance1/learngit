Learning git work flow

The following are the general steps you should follow in creating a pull request. Subsequent pull requests only need to follow step 3 and beyond:

1.Fork the repository on GitHub
2.Clone the forked repository to your machine
3.Create a "feature" branch in your local repository
4.Make your changes and commit them to your local repository
5.Rebase and push your commits to your GitHub remote fork/repository
6.Issue a Pull Request to the official repository
7.Your Pull Request is reviewed by a committer and merged into the repository
