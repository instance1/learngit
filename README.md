Learning git work flow

The following are the general steps you should follow in creating a pull request. Subsequent pull requests only need to follow step 3 and beyond:

Fork the repository on GitHub
Clone the forked repository to your machine
Create a "feature" branch in your local repository
Make your changes and commit them to your local repository
Rebase and push your commits to your GitHub remote fork/repository
Issue a Pull Request to the official repository
Your Pull Request is reviewed by a committer and merged into the repository
